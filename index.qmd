title: "Why Rio Tinto Is My First Choice?"
---

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my strong interest in choosing Rio Tinto for my Capstone project. I believe that this project aligns perfectly with my career goals and will provide me with valuable experience and skills that will give me an edge in the job market.

As you may know, my career goal is to work as a Data Scientist in the mining industry after graduation. Therefore, the opportunity to work on a project with Rio Tinto, a leading mining company, is incredibly exciting to me. By participating in this project, I will gain valuable insights into the industry and acquire hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world problems. This will not only enhance my resume but also give me a competitive advantage when applying for jobs in the future.

Furthermore, I am deeply interested in the application of deep learning-based NLP in traditional industries. I believe that this field has immense potential and offers many opportunities for innovation. The core of the Rio Tinto project is to develop a customized named entity recognition system, which I find challenging but fascinating. This project will allow me to apply my knowledge of NLP and deep learning to a real-world problem and develop a system that can add value to the company.

I take the selection of my Capstone project very seriously, and I want to ensure that I choose a project that will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the company. I spent a significant amount of time reviewing each video proposal before the Capstone Fair, analyzing the skills involved, the company's core business, and the scope of the project. During the Capstone fair, I had in-depth discussions with the representatives of my top four choices, and after careful consideration, I decided that the Rio Tinto project is the best fit for me.

I understand that there are limited spots available for this project, and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to the team. I am committed to putting in the necessary effort to ensure that the project is a success and that the results can be implemented in the company. I would be incredibly grateful if you could support my application and allow me to participate in this project.

Thank you for considering my request!

Sincerely,

Mingcong Li
